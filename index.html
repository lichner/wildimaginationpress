        <p>Rebecca is dedicated to creating engaging children's literature that combines learning with joy. As a debut author, she believes that every child deserves stories that make them laugh, learn, dream and imagine.</p>
        <p>Her inspiration for "One Puppy, Two Puppies, Hey What Do You Do?" came from watching children's natural curiosity about animals and numbers. She wanted to create a book that would make counting as fun as playing with puppies!</p>
