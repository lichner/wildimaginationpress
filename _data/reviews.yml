    title: "Magical story"
    text: "A beautifully written book that captures the magic of childhood in Australia. Our children loved reading it and it sparked many conversations about caring for the bush. It took me back to my childhood and the adventures that we had in the bush. The book will become a firm favourite bed time story especially when we are travelling in our caravan."

    title: "A wonderful children's book."
    text: "Being a children's book, I am glad I went with the hard copy instead of the kindle. The illustrations & the physical nature of the paper print just feels so much better with the hard copy. The story is nice and engaging and connects well with kids. It is meaningful and the subtle messaging about being responsible was conveyed well. Looking forward to more work from Rebecca"

    title: "A reminder of a simpler kind of play"
    text: "Bushlandia is a delightful celebration of imagination and the magic of the Australian bush. Through the eyes of children, the story unfolds into an imaginative new world where the bush itself is alive with possibility.\n In an age where screens often dominate young minds, Bushlandia feels refreshingly timeless. It reminds readers of a simpler kind of play, the kind driven by curiosity, creativity, and connection to nature. The children in this story explore, invent, and collaborate, showing how imagination can transform the ordinary into something extraordinary. The Australian bush is more than just a setting; it becomes a character in its own right, encouraging exploration and respect for the natural world. Young readers will be inspired to step outside, while adults may find themselves nostalgic for the freedom and wonder of their own childhood adventures. Bushlandia is a beautiful reminder that the greatest adventures don’t require batteries or screens, just imagination, friendship, and the courage to explore. It is a wonderful read for children and a meaningful story for parents and educators who value creative, outdoor play."
