    title: "Magical story"
    text: "A beautifully written book that captures the magic of childhood in Australia. Our children loved reading it and it sparked many conversations about caring for the bush. It took me back to my childhood and the adventures that we had in the bush. The book will become a firm favourite bed time story especially when we are travelling in our caravan."

    title: "A wonderful children's book."
    text: "Being a children's book, I am glad I went with the hard copy instead of the kindle. The illustrations & the physical nature of the paper print just feels so much better with the hard copy. The story is nice and engaging and connects well with kids. It is meaningful and the subtle messaging about being responsible was conveyed well. Looking forward to more work from Rebecca"

This book also encourages children to get away from screen time and develop their own fun, whether inside or outside the home. A must read !!"
