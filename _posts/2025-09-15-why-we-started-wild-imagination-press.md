Every great story begins with a spark of imagination. For Wild Imagination Press, that spark ignited from a simple but powerful belief: **every child deserves stories that make them laugh, learn, dream, and imagine**.

## The Beginning of Our Journey

Wild Imagination Press was born from the courage to follow a dream—turning a love of storytelling and creativity into a venture that inspires imagination and connects children with the natural world. As the author of Bushlandia, I’m inspired by the wild beauty of the Australian bush and the boundless imagination of children. My work celebrates the connection between nature and creativity—encouraging young readers to explore, dream, and see magic in the world around them.

Children's literature has the incredible power to shape young minds, spark curiosity, and plant seeds of wonder that grow throughout a lifetime. 

## Our Mission: Where Stories Grow Like Magic

The name "Wild Imagination Press" captures everything we stand for. **Wild** represents the untamed creativity of childhood, the freedom to explore, play, and discover. It's also a nod to our Australian naturescapes that inspires so many of our stories - the bush, the wildlife, the beach, the raw beauty of nature that surrounds us.

**Imagination** is at the heart of everything we do. We believe imagination is not just about fantasy; it's the foundation of problem - solving, empathy, innovation, collaboration and joy. When children imagine, so too does their creativity.

**Press** reflects our commitment to quality publishing - creating books that are not just products, but treasured companions on a child's reading journey.

## What Makes Us Different

### 1. **Australian Heart, Universal Themes**

Our stories are rooted in Australian landscapes and experiences, from the unique wildlife of the bush to the everyday adventures of childhood Down Under. But the themes - friendship and teamwork, creativity, imagination, environmental stewardship, learning through play - resonate with families everywhere.

### 2. **Learning Through Joyful Engagement**

We believe education should never feel like work for young children. Our books weave learning naturally into delightful narratives. Whether it's discovering environmental responsibility and deepening problem-solving skills through bush adventures or counting with playful puppies, the learning happens organically through the joy of the story.

### 3. **Quality Over Quantity**

As an independent publisher, we have the freedom to focus on creating exceptional books. Every story is crafted with purposeful intention, every illustration chosen with care, every page designed to nurture young imaginative minds.

### 4. **Connection to Nature**

In our increasingly digital world, we're passionate about fostering children's connection to the natural world. Our books inspire outdoor imaginative play, environmental awareness, creativity and appreciation for the living world around us.

## Our First Two Books

Wild Imagination Press launches with two standout titles that bring our philosophy to life - stories that inspire creativity, curiosity, and a love of the natural world.

We're launching with two very special books that embody our philosophy:

**[Bushlandia](/books/bushlandia/)** invites readers aged 7 - 10 into the heart of the Australian bush, where four children dream, create, and build their own nature town. It’s a celebration of imagination, friendship, and environmental care. Bushlandia: The Trilogy is on the horizon - watch this space for the adventures still to come.

**[One Puppy, Two Puppies, Hey What Do You Do?](/books/one-puppy-two-puppies/)** is a delightful counting book for ages 0 - 4, following ten playful puppies through fun daily activities. It combines early maths learning with the joy of animals and the special bond between children and their beloved pets.

While our books are created for different age groups and learning journeys, they share a common purpose: to make learning a creative and imaginative adventure, and to inspire a lifelong love of reading and discovery.

## What's Next for Wild Imagination Press

This is just the start. From our imagination garden, new stories are coming to life - featuring Australia’s wildlife, outdoor adventures, and meaningful tales that nurture empathy, creativity, and emotional and mental wellbeing.

We're also planning to create **resources for parents and educators** - activity guides, reading tips, and creative extensions that help bring our books to life beyond the page.

## A Personal Note

Starting Wild Imagination Press has been one of the most fulfilling adventures of my life. Every time I imagine a child immersed in one of our stories, learning something new, or being inspired to explore the natural world, my heart is filled with gratitude.

Thank you for being here at the beginning of this journey. Your support means everything, and I can't wait to share more stories with you and the young readers in your life.

Here's to wild imaginations, magical stories, and the children who will carry them forward.

With gratitude and excitement,
