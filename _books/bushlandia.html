  Summer holidays have just begun, but Lila, Finn, Leo, and Tamsin are already feeling restless. Until someone suggests the perfect solution - let's go bush! What starts as a simple walk into the Australian wilderness becomes something extraordinary when they discover the perfect spot to build their very own town.<br/>
  Welcome to <b>Bushlandia</b>, a nature-based setting where fallen logs become community tables, rock ledges transform into bakeries, and imagination runs as wild as the native animals. But creating their bush paradise isn't just fun and games; they also learn to respect nature, work as a team, and leave no trace behind.<br/>
  When mysterious damage appears in their town and a magical lyrebird becomes their guardian, the children realise they're becoming environmental stewards, learning lessons that will last a lifetime.<br/>
